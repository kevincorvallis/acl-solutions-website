            <h1>Shredders Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2, 2026</p>

            <p>Welcome to Shredders, an application operated by ACL Solutions LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Shredders mobile application and web application (collectively, the "App"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using Shredders, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Shredders provides snow conditions, weather forecasts, powder scores, and trip planning information for ski resorts and mountains in the Pacific Northwest region. The App includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time snow depth and snowfall data from SNOTEL stations</li>
                <li>Weather forecasts and conditions</li>
                <li>AI-generated powder scores and recommendations</li>
                <li>Road conditions and trip planning information</li>
                <li>An AI chat assistant for questions about conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Important Disclaimers</h2>

            <h3>Weather and Snow Data</h3>
            <p><strong>THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SHREDDERS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</strong> Snow conditions, weather forecasts, powder scores, and other data displayed in the App are aggregated from third-party sources and may not be accurate, complete, or current. Actual conditions at ski resorts and mountains may differ significantly from what is displayed in the App.</p>

            <h3>Powder Scores</h3>
            <p>Powder scores are AI-generated estimates based on available data and algorithms. They are subjective indicators and should not be relied upon as accurate predictions of skiing or snowboarding conditions. Your experience may vary based on many factors not captured by our scoring system.</p>

            <h3>Safety Responsibility</h3>
            <p><strong>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.</strong> Always check official resort websites, call resort hotlines, and verify conditions independently before traveling. Never rely solely on Shredders for decisions about whether to ski, snowboard, or travel to a mountain. Winter mountain travel involves inherent risks including but not limited to avalanches, accidents, changing weather conditions, and road hazards.</p>

            <h3>Road Conditions</h3>
            <p>Road condition and pass status information is provided for convenience only. Always check official state department of transportation websites and road condition hotlines before traveling. Road conditions can change rapidly and the App may not reflect current conditions.</p>

            <h2>4. AI Chat Assistant</h2>
            <p>The AI chat assistant is provided as a convenience feature. Responses are AI-generated and may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. The AI assistant does not have real-time access to resort operations and cannot provide information about lift status, grooming, terrain park conditions, or other operational details. Do not rely on the AI assistant for safety-critical decisions.</p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Data Sources</h2>
            <p>Shredders aggregates data from third-party sources including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SNOTEL (USDA):</strong> Snow and precipitation monitoring data</li>
                <li><strong>NOAA/National Weather Service:</strong> Weather forecasts</li>
                <li><strong>Open-Meteo:</strong> Weather data</li>
                <li><strong>State DOTs:</strong> Road condition information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not control these data sources and make no representations or warranties about their accuracy, availability, or timeliness. These services may experience outages, delays, or errors that affect the information displayed in the App.</p>
